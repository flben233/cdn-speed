# CDN Speedtest

## Usage

Note: You need to replace the file name according to the releases page and your architecture. It's `linux-amd64` currently.

```shell
wget https://sh.lolicon.llc/download/flben233/cdn-speed/cdn-speed-linux-amd64 && chmod +x ./cdn-speed-linux-amd64 && { ./cdn-speed-linux-amd64; rm -f ./cdn-speed-linux-amd64; }
```

If you want to keep the binary, use this:

```shell
wget https://sh.lolicon.llc/download/flben233/cdn-speed/cdn-speed-linux-amd64 && chmod +x ./cdn-speed-linux-amd64 && ./cdn-speed-linux-amd64
```
